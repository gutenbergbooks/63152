<h3>
SIR GEORGE ARTHUR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION OF UPPER CANADA.
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The last Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada before the
Union of 1841 was Sir George Arthur.  To most Canadians
of to-day he is little more than a name, but still he played
an important part in the stirring events of our political life
fourscore years ago.  He lacked the picturesqueness of that
extraordinary personage, his predecessor in office, Sir Francis
Bond Head, and he was overshadowed completely by both Lord
Durham to Poulett Thomson, better known as Lord Sydenham,
who were in succession as Governors-General placed in
authority over him.  None the less he lives in Canadian history
as the man who refused to reprieve Lount and Matthews, and
who made common cause with the Family Compact against the
Reformers.  Although nominally he was Lieutenant-Governor
of Upper Canada from his appointment in 1837 until the Act
of Union went into force, his real term of office lasted only a
little more than a year and a half, from March 23rd, 1838,
until November 22nd, 1839.  After that time he was directly
subordinate to Sydenham.  During that brief period Sir
George Arthur proved himself an energetic if not always
merciful governor.
</p>

<p>
It was unfortunate that Arthur come to Upper Canada at
a time when Mackenzie's rebellion had just been crushed and
when party feeling was still running very high.  Sir Francis
Bond Head left Toronto on the very day that Sir George
Arthur arrived and so the new Lieutenant-Governor was
unable to obtain much information from his predecessor.  There
is reason to believe, none the less, that Sir Francis put in a
good word for his old friends the Family Compact and that
Arthur from the beginning of his term of office favoured that
party.  In his first official despatch to Lord Glenelg dated
March 29th, 1838, Sir George makes mention of the "large
preponderating party looking to the Executive Government to
put down treason by energetic measures," as opposed to "the
party styling themselves Reformers" who were "hoping for
the most lenient course."[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]  These phrases, written when
Arthur had been only about a week in Upper Canada, stamp
the new governor at once as an opponent of reform.  If
further proof is needed it can readily be found in Arthur's reply
to a congratulatory address from seven hundred and fifty
citizens of Toronto upon the occasion of his arrival in that
city.  In that address reference was made to the fact that "in
the promotion of public order, and the adoption of measures
for the pacification of the country" Arthur would have "the
prompt and energetic support of the loyal, patriotic and
constitutional reformers of the Province."  In his reply Sir
George Arthur regretted that "any portion of the inhabitants
of this city should have felt it necessary at the moment to
present themselves under the character of reformers, as a
distinct class of the people of this Province."  Such a statement
was not likely to secure for Sir George Arthur the whole-hearted
support of all the well-disposed citizens of Toronto.
The execution of Lount and Matthews further alienated the
more moderate men in the Province.
</p>

<p>
When Sir Francis Head arrived in Toronto he was greeted
by placards which designated him as "a Tried Reformer."[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>]  When
Sir George Arthur was appointed to succeed him the
London <i>Atlas</i>, on March 3rd, 1838, enquired, "What will the
inhabitants of Upper Canada think of the appointment of the
Governor of a penal Colony to rule over a province of
freemen?"[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>]  As a matter of fact, Arthur was an improvement on
Head but he was never able to shake off his past traditions or
to obtain as Lord Durham and Lord Sydenham did, a real
insight into Upper Canadian conditions.  Durham, it is true,
in his Report is not nearly so successful when he deals with
the upper province as when he portrays the miseries of Lower
Canada, but he understood the situation there better than
Head or Arthur ever did.  Sydenham's ideas as to the
workings of Responsible Government did not harmonize with those
of Lord Elgin, but he never would have argued against it, as
Arthur did, on the grounds that it was demanded by the
Reformers.  From start to finish of his term of office in Upper
Canada Sir George Arthur was unable to forget his experience
in British Honduras where he quelled a negro insurrection and
in Van Diemen's Land, now Tasmania, where he was called
upon to rule a convict settlement.  Above all he was a military
officer, and as such was none too ready to season justice with
mercy.  He was the last of that series of Lieutenant-Governors
of Upper Canada who were also military officers and he possessed
the defects of his qualities.  Stern, unbending, narrow-minded,
but entirely honest he was totally unable to see his
opponent's point of view.
</p>

<p>
By training Sir George Arthur was a soldier.  Before he
ever embarked on his administrative career as governor of one
colonial dependency after another he had served many years
in the army.  Born in 1784, the youngest son of John Arthur
of Norley House, Plymouth, George Arthur entered the army
at the age of twenty.  He saw service in Italy, Egypt&mdash;where
he was wounded at Rosetta in 1807&mdash;and also in Sicily in 1808.
He took part in the ill-fated Walcheren Expedition of 1809
and seems to have distinguished himself in it, since we read
that he was thanked in general orders and also that he received
the freedom of the city of London.  After being military
secretary to Sir George Don, the governor of the island of Jersey;
Arthur, in 1812, became a major in the Seventh West India
Regiment.  We next find him in Jamaica as assistant
quartermaster-general of the forces on that island.
</p>

<p>
In 1814 George Arthur became Lieutenant-Governor of
British Honduras "with the rank of colonel on the staff."[<a id="chap01fn4text"></a><a href="#chap01fn4">4</a>]  This
office, which was both civil and military, Arthur
held until 1822, during which time he suppressed a serious
revolt of the slave population.  His despatches on the subject
of slavery we are told attracted the attention of the great
abolitionist, William Wilberforce.  In 1822 Colonel Arthur
returned to England on leave of absence in order to furnish
the British Government with additional information on the
subject of the emancipation of slaves.  It was during this stay
in England that he was in 1824 appointed Lieutenant-Governor
of Van Diemen's Land and at the same time commander of the
military forces in that penal colony.
</p>

<p>
For twelve years George Arthur grappled with the terrible
conditions existing in that most unfortunate island.  The
transportation system, one of the worst blots in British colonial
history, was then at its height and its evils were only too
apparent.  The Select Committee on Transportation appointed
by the British Parliament in its Report submitted in 1838,
having outlined the unspeakable conditions existing at Norfolk
Island, goes on to make the following statement regarding Van
Diemen's Land:
</p>

<p>
"Your Committee will not lengthen this report by describing
the penal settlements of Van Diemen's Land, where the
severity of the system is as great as, if not greater than, that
at Norfolk Island, where culprits are as reckless, if not more
reckless, commissing murder" (to use the words of Sir George
Arthur) "in order to enjoy the excitement of being sent up to
Hobart Town for trial, though aware that in the ordinary
course they must be executed within a fortnight after
arrival."[<a id="chap01fn5text"></a><a href="#chap01fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
As Lieutenant-Governor of such a colony Colonel Arthur
was called upon to act with firmness and often with severity.
His biographer in the Dictionary of National Biography, Sir
Alexander John Arbuthnot, K.C.S.I., claims that the object of
Arthur's appointment was "the introduction of an improved
system" of treatment for the convicts.  Arthur sought to adopt
"a middle course between the extreme severity of the system
which would make transportation simply deterrent and the
over-indulgence of the system which aimed at reforming the
convict by gentler treatment.  He held that it was possible to
make transportation a punishment much dreaded by criminals
whilst offering every facility for reform to those who were not
hardened in crime; but he entertained no quixotic expectations
of frequent reformation."[<a id="chap01fn6text"></a><a href="#chap01fn6">6</a>]  It will be seen from this
quotation that Arthur believed in the transportation system in a
modified and "improved" form.  In this he ran counter to the
wishes of the colonists who desired that an end be put to the
abomination.  Arthur's biographer regrets that "the colonists
and their friends in England were bent on putting an end to
the transportation system and their views ultimately
prevailed."
</p>

<p>
This difference of opinion between Arthur and the colonists
furnished W. L. MacKenzie with some of his choicest bits
of invective against the new Lieutenant-Governor of Upper
Canada.  In his <i>Gazette</i>, MacKenzie prefaced a long series of
excerpts from the newspapers of Van Diemen's Land on the
occasion of Arthur's recall with the sarcasm: "Such credentials
cannot fail to increase the loyalty of the happy Canadians.
O, the blessings of Colonial Dependence!!!"[<a id="chap01fn7text"></a><a href="#chap01fn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
These excerpts clearly show that there was a considerable
body of colonial opinion in Van Diemen's Land opposed to the
policies of Governor Arthur.  The following from the Hobart
Town <i>News</i> may be taken as fairly typical.  As a matter of
fact it is quite moderate in tone in comparison with some of
the other invectives against Arthur.
</p>

<p>
"It was with feelings of the most sincere satisfaction, we
announced in our last number the arrival of the 'good ship'
"Elphinstone", from England, bringing the very gratifying
intelligence of the recall of Colonel George Arthur after an
administration of twelve years; during the whole of which
long period the people have been rendered wretched, unhappy,
discontented and miserable by the misrule of his
government...."[<a id="chap01fn8text"></a><a href="#chap01fn8">8</a>]
</p>

<p>
Of course, no one would look into the pages of MacKenzie's
<i>Gazette</i> to get a favourable impression of Sir George Arthur,
but a perusal of these excerpts shows that the dissatisfaction
against Arthur was widespread.  The Launcetown <i>Advertiser</i>
states that, "Throughout the whole period of his government
the military have been placed in too prominent a position.
Lieutenants and Ensigns, fresh from the frolics of Chatham,
have been turned into justices of the peace and the whole
administration of the colony has been pipe-clayed into a service
of an amphibious, half-military, half-civil complexion."[<a id="chap01fn9text"></a><a href="#chap01fn9">9</a>]  The
<i>Colonial Times</i> quite frankly lays it down that "A worse
British Governor never ruled during the present century."[<a id="chap01fn10text"></a><a href="#chap01fn10">10</a>]  This
is strong language, written in the heat of the moment, but
when sufficient discount is made for hot temper the fact
remains that Sir George Arthur made a number of enemies in
Van Diemen's Land.
</p>

<p>
To a certain extent Arthur was not to blame since he was
the victim of circumstances.  He was forced by the nature of
his office to uphold the abominable system of transportation
and his position as commander-in-chief of the military forces
on the island made him a military as well as a civil governor
of a penal colony.  But on the other hand, he was by nature an
aristocrat with but little democratic feeling.  He mistrusted
popular government and he had to keep down a discontented
population of whom over one-third were convicts.  Sir William
Molesworth in his speech on transportation delivered in
the British House of Commons on May 5th, 1840,[<a id="chap01fn11text"></a><a href="#chap01fn11">11</a>] gives the
following statistics culled from Sir George Arthur's
despatches from Van Diemen's Land in 1834.  "Its population in
1834 did not exceed 40,000, of whom 16,000 were convicts,
1,000 soldiers, and 23,000 free inhabitants; what proportion
of the latter had been convicts it is impossible to say.  In this
small community the summary convictions amounted to about
15,000 in the year in question, amongst which there were
about 2,000 for felony, 1,200 for misdemeanour, 700 for
assaults, and 3,000 for drunkenness.  Eleven thousand of these
convictions were of convicts who are summarily punished for
all offences to which the penalty of death is not attached."  With
such a turbulent population to control it is no wonder
that Sir George Arthur had but little belief in popular
government.
</p>

<p>
But however great the opposition to Governor Arthur in
Van Diemen's Land may have been, the Australian Commonwealth
to-day owes him one debt of gratitude.  According to
his biographer Arbuthnot, Arthur was the first person to
suggest the advisability of a federation of all the Australian
colonies.  In this he was years in advance of his time.  Still it
is to be doubted whether any scheme of federation brought
forward in Arthur's time could have been so complete and
satisfactory as that consummated in 1901.
</p>

<p>
After his return to England in March, 1837, Colonel
Arthur received the Hanoverian Order of Knighthood.  At the
close of the same year he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor
of Upper Canada and at the same time given "the military
rank and command of a major-general on the staff."  Sir
George Arthur was now nearly sixty years of age and had
been for over twenty-two years a colonial governor.  During
that period he had wielded almost despotic power.  It was not
at all likely that he would be inclined to look with favour upon
the demands of the Upper Canadian Reformers for "Responsible
Government."
</p>

<p>
On his arrival in Upper Canada Sir George Arthur was
faced by a situation of the utmost delicacy.  The rashness and
wrong-headedness of Sir Francis Bond Head and of William
Lyon MacKenzie had brought on the Upper Canadian Rebellion.
The skirmish at Montgomery's Tavern occurred on
Thursday, December 7th, 1837, and at the close of the day
W. L. MacKenzie was a fugitive with a price on his head.  The
affair of the "Caroline" took place on December 29th.  The
destruction of this American steamboat resulted in considerable
excitement in the United States and relations between the
British and American governments became somewhat strained.
The arrest and trial of Alexander McLeod on the charge
of murdering Amos Durfee, an American citizen, who was
killed during the raid on the "Caroline", further complicated
the situation.  It was not until 1842 that the incident was
finally closed by a letter of apology addressed by Sir Robert
Peel to Daniel Webster.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after the destruction of the "Caroline" by the
Canadians, MacKenzie's sympathizers, who had seized Navy
Island in the Niagara River near the Falls, were forced to
abandon their post, and the centre of disturbance shifted
westward to the Detroit River.  On this frontier an attack was
planned by American sympathizers and disaffected Canadians
against Fort Madden which was situated sixteen miles from
Windsor, Ontario.  The attempt proved disastrous and
resulted in the capture of "General" Theller and other American
sympathizers, who were sent to Toronto for trial.  On the 3rd
of March, 1838, Pelee Island in Lake Erie was captured by
another band of invaders who were driven off by a Canadian
loyalist force under Colonel Maitland.  This was the last
serious attempt made from the United States before the
arrival in Upper Canada of Sir George Arthur.
</p>

<p>
The new Lieutenant-Governor then found himself involved
in a peculiar international situation.  Were these
American sympathizers foreigners who were levying open war
against the province committed to his charge, or were they
merely marauders to be classed as pirates?  This problem
complicated another question of the utmost and pressing
importance which was, in what way were the leaders of the late
rebellion to be treated?  The Family Compact men and the
Tories generally thirsted for their blood.  Two of the leaders
of MacKenzie's rebellion, Lount and Matthews, were already
in prison and were shortly to be put on trial for their lives.
The problem which Sir George Arthur had to settle was
whether or not the extreme penalty of the law should be
exacted.
</p>

<p>
It was not to be expected that the ex-governor of a penal
colony would show much mercy towards these men who had
taken up arms against constituted authority.  Nor did he.
Lount and Matthews pleaded guilty and were on March 29th
sentenced to death.  The execution was to take place on April
12th.  Sir George Arthur had, of course, no part in sentencing
them to death.  That was done by Chief Justice John Beverley
Robinson, who, Kingsford tells us, pronounced sentence "with
that felicity of language ever at his command, but its tone was
merciless."[<a id="chap01fn12text"></a><a href="#chap01fn12">12</a>]  Sir John Beverley Robinson's son and biographer,
Major-General C. W. Robinson, quotes from the <i>Law
Journal</i> of Upper Canada for March, 1863, to show that "of
the three individuals concerned, the Chief Justice was most
certainly the most painfully affected."  But whatever his
private feelings may have been the Chief Justice was unbending
in his determination that no mercy be shown.  He refused to
advise the Lieutenant-Governor that Lount and Matthews be
either pardoned or respited.[<a id="chap01fn13text"></a><a href="#chap01fn13">13</a>]  In this opinion of the Chief
Justice the Attorney-General, Hagerman, concurred, and
although there was great excitement in the province and
"petitions signed by not less than 8,000 persons"[<a id="chap01fn14text"></a><a href="#chap01fn14">14</a>] were presented,
a reprieve was not granted and the two rebel leaders were
executed on the day set.
</p>

<p>
Two days later, on April 14th, Arthur penned a long
dispatch on the subject to Lord Glenelg.  This document shows
clearly how completely the new Lieutenant-Governor was in
sympathy with the Family Compact and how entirely he failed
to understand the point of view of the Reformers.
</p>

<p>
The despatch professes to deal with the cases of Samuel
Lount and Peter Matthews, "with a general view of the course
to be taken with respect to persons committed for High
Treason."  Arthur begins by combatting a statement made by
Lord Glenelg in a despatch dated January 6th, 1835, addressed
to Sir John Colborne and marked "separate," to the effect that,
</p>

<p>
"Her Majesty's Government could not fail to notice the
wide difference which exists between the circumstances which
have taken place in Lower Canada, and the recent events in
Upper Canada.  So far as can be collected from the information
now before me, the chief motive which influenced the
instigation of the disturbance in Upper Canada appears to have
been the view of plunder, and the offences which they
perpetrated, seem to bear comparatively little of a political
character."
</p>

<p>
Lord Glenelg's grasp of the situation in Upper Canada
may be inferred from the above passage and Sir George
Arthur proceeds to enlighten him.  Several sentences from his
despatch deserve quoting in full, since they show how readily
Sir George Arthur had embraced the Tory point of view.
</p>

<p>
"In Upper Canada, the same pretensions to patriotism&mdash;the
same assertions of republican Principles&mdash;the same accusations
against the Government of Tyranny and Corruption&mdash;were
put forth as the ground and justification of the Rebellion
as in the Lower Province.  In Lower Canada, the right was
insisted on, of the popular Branch of the Legislature sullenly
to refuse acting as a legislative Body, and to bring to a
complete stop all beneficial operations of Government, and to
assert a supremacy inconsistent with the relations of a Colony
with the parent state.
</p>

<p>
"In Upper Canada arms were taken up with the avowed
purpose of assisting the Lower Canadians, and of asserting
the same principles as applicable to this Colony.  In Upper
Canada the majority of the Assembly were attached to British
Institutions; but this Majority was asserted to have been
brought about by unconstitutional means on the part of
Government, and the use which the revolutionary Party had made
of a majority in Parliament when they had it, was precisely
the same here as in Lower Canada: namely, to coerce the
Government by a refusal to grant the necessary supplies.  The
Revolutionists in neither province hoped by themselves to
overthrow the Government.  They alike solicited foreign aid,
and by its means expected to accomplish those designs...."
</p>

<p>
It may easily be seen from the above quotation that Sir
George Arthur misunderstood the political situation in both
Upper and Lower Canada.  He failed entirely to appreciate
the aims of the Reformers and considered them a grave menace
to the security of British rule in Canada.  So imbued was
he with the point of view of what he terms the "Constitutional
Party" that he believed the rebel leaders, including Lount and
Matthews, had proved "not only that they were determined,
with their own hands, to execute the foulest deeds in furtherance
of their project of subverting the Government; but they
had encouraged a class of dissolute and vagrant Foreigners to
join in their enterprise, who, they well knew, would not
hesitate to inflict upon the inhabitants of this Province, if they
could have subjugated them, the most barbarous atrocities."[<a id="chap01fn15text"></a><a href="#chap01fn15">15</a>]
</p>

<p>
Under such circumstances, if the British connexion was
to be preserved and law and order firmly re-established, it was
necessary, Arthur considered, that several public examples
should be made.  Lount and Matthews had pleaded guilty of
the heinous crime of rebellion against authority and were
convicted of high treason.  The penalty was death and it made
no difference to Sir George Arthur whether eight thousand or
thirty thousand[<a id="chap01fn16text"></a><a href="#chap01fn16">16</a>] persons signed petitions for their reprieve.
He could not understand that Lount and Matthews were in
the eyes of a very large section of the province merely political
prisoners who had been unfortunate enough to appeal to arms
and be defeated by their opponents of the Tory party.  The
fact that the Lieutenant-Governor and the Executive Council
were adherents of this Tory party did not, in itself, mean that
Lount and Matthews were traitors.  High treason is a very
serious thing and so is armed rebellion, but the skirmish at
Montgomery's Tavern could hardly be called a battle and there
had been great provocation.
</p>

<p>
In refusing to reprieve Lount and Matthews or even to
postpone their execution until he had had an opportunity to
confer with the Colonial Office, Sir George Arthur made the
chief blunder of his career as Lieutenant-Governor of Upper
Canada.  To be sure he acted in complete harmony with his
Executive Council, whose advice he took in the matter, but
he did not understand the real feeling of the province.  It is
doubtful whether any but the most rabid Tories favoured the
exaction of the death penalty.  The ends of justice could have
been secured either by transportation or banishment.  Nor
did the Colonial Office entirely favour the executions of these
men.  On May 22nd Lord Glenelg wrote to Arthur as follows:
</p>

<p>
"I have received your despatch of the 29th March, No. 1,
reporting your proceedings up to that date, and the measures
which you proposed to adopt with reference to the militia and
volunteers, and stating that two of the most active of the
persons engaged in the late revolt, having been brought to trial,
had pleaded guilty and been sentenced to death, and assuring
me that the most merciful consideration would be shown
towards the prisoners generally.
</p>

<p>
"I have laid your despatch before the Queen, and have to
convey to you Her Majesty's approbation of the proceedings
which you have reported.  Since the receipt, indeed, of your
despatch, intelligence has appeared in the public papers of the
execution at Toronto of Messrs. Lount and Matthews, the
individuals, as I presume, alluded to in your despatch.
</p>

<p>
"I have every confidence that before consenting to such a
means, you devoted to the cases of these persons a calm and
dispassionate consideration, but as I have hitherto received
from you no report of these executions or of the grounds on
which you decided to let the law take its course, I abstain for
the present from any further comment on them.
</p>

<p>
"I am happy to learn, through the same channel of
information, that no further executions were likely to take
place."[<a id="chap01fn17text"></a><a href="#chap01fn17">17</a>]
</p>

<p>
Eight days later, on May 30th, 1838, after receiving Sir
George Arthur's despatch of the 14th of April, Lord Glenelg
again alluded to the execution and this time one feels that, in
his own mild way, the Colonial Secretary is seeking to restrain
Arthur:
</p>

<p>
"I have received your despatch of the 14th April last
(No. 4), reporting the executions, on the 12th of that month,
of Lount and Matthews, who had been convicted, on their own
confession, of 'high treason,' and explaining, at considerable
length, the views adopted by yourself and the Executive
Council with regard to these prisoners, and the considerations
which appeared to you imperatively to demand that the law
in the case should be allowed to take its course.
</p>

<p>
"Her Majesty's Government regret extremely that a paramount
necessity should have arisen for these examples of
severity.  They are, however, fully convinced that you did not
consent to the execution of these individuals without having
given the most ample consideration to all the circumstances
of the case, and they have no reason to doubt the necessity of
the course which, with the entire concurrence of the Executive
Council, you felt it your duty to adopt."[<a id="chap01fn18text"></a><a href="#chap01fn18">18</a>]
</p>

<p>
The Colonial Secretary did not censure Arthur for his
conduct in the matter of the execution of Lount and Matthews
but he added a significant paragraph regarding the treatment
of other political prisoners.
</p>

<p>
"With respect to the disposal of the other prisoners, Her
Majesty's Government cannot give you any specific instructions,
until they shall have received the report which you lead
me to expect.  But I cannot defer expressing our earnest hope
that, with respect to these persons, your opinion that no
further capital punishments will be necessary, may be acted on.
Nothing would cause Her Majesty's Government more sincere
regret than an unnecessary recourse to the punishment of
death, and I am persuaded that the same feeling will influence
not only yourself, but the Executive Council.  The examples
which have been made in the case of the most guilty will be
sufficient to warn others of the consequences to which they
render themselves liable by such crimes, and this object having
been accomplished, no further advantage could be gained by
indict the extreme penalty of the law on any of their
associates."[<a id="chap01fn19text"></a><a href="#chap01fn19">19</a>]
</p>

<p>
The death of Lount and Matthews seems to have satisfied
the desire for revenge on the part of the extremists and a
milder course of policy was then pursued by the Lieutenant-Governor
and Executive Council.  Several other leaders including
"Generals" Sutherland and Theller, both of whom
were American citizens, were sentenced to transportation.
Theller had been sentenced to death and, according to his own
account, was only saved from the gallows by the energetic
agitation in his favour of the Irish section of the population.
He has left a voluminous account of his captivity, including
his sensational escape from the Citadel of Quebec, in his book,
<i>Canada in 1837-8</i>, to which the reader is referred if he wishes
to obtain a very highly-coloured bit of autobiography.[<a id="chap01fn20text"></a><a href="#chap01fn20">20</a>]
</p>

<p>
Theller's case brought up a very interesting question of
International Law.  He had been born in Ireland and had
become naturalized as an American citizen.  When put on trial
for his life on a charge of high treason Theller pleaded that
his American naturalization had rendered him no longer a
British subject.  Against him a precedent of 1747 was quoted
to support the doctrine of "perpetual allegiance," i.e. "once a
British subject, always a British subject."  The jury brought
in the curious verdict that "if the prisoner was a British
subject he was guilty of treason."  Chief Justice Robinson, acting
in accordance with his belief in the doctrine of 'perpetual
allegiance' ruled that Theller was still a British subject and
thereupon sentenced him to death.  Under the circumstances to
carry out the death sentence would have been very inadvisable.
Pressure was brought to bear upon the Lieutenant-Governor
and the Executive Council, and as a result a respite was
granted "until Her Majesty's pleasure should be known."[<a id="chap01fn21text"></a><a href="#chap01fn21">21</a>]  Theller
was soon after removed from Toronto to Quebec and
detained there in the Citadel, from which he escaped.
Sutherland was tried by court martial, imprisoned in Toronto and
Quebec, and finally returned to American soil.
</p>

<p>
These American prisoners were very embarrassing to the
Upper Canadian authorities.  There was still considerable
excitement along the American frontier and the danger of
invasion was by no means over.  Lount and Matthews were
considered martyrs by many on the American side of the border.
Highly coloured accounts of the execution appeared in the
American press.  Even the New York Sun took up the matter
and recounted how Mrs. Lount on the day previous to her
husband's execution "pleaded with Governor Arthur for hours for
his life, and when she pointed to <i>thirty thousand names</i> who
petitioned with her for the exercise of the royal prerogative,
he coldly replied 'that he had not believed that Mr. Lount had
so many friends in the province, and that there was the more
necessity that he should be made an example to the rest.'"[<a id="chap01fn22text"></a><a href="#chap01fn22">22</a>]  Under
these circumstances the execution of Theller would
have added oil to the flame.
</p>

<p>
The Congress of the United States passed a "Neutrality
Bill" which cleared up the situation a great deal by denying
official sanction to any schemes of invasion and enjoining
neutrality on all American citizens.  The state authorities along
the frontier also tried to prevent any movement of armed
forces against Canada.  Theller records how he successfully
dodged the American authorities in making his attack on
Fort Madden and how Governor Mason of Michigan was
coming down the river with a strong force when Theller and his
friends approached the island of Bois Blanc which lies in
Canadian waters.  No doubt there often was a certain amount
of laxity on the part of the American authorities, and Sir
George Arthur finds occasion to condemn it at times, but the
United States Government seems on the whole to have acted
very wisely.  The burning of the "Caroline," which it should
be remembered was an American vessel attacked by a Canadian
force in American waters, might easily have led to very
serious consequences.  If President Van Buren and his cabinet
had wanted war it would have been quite possible to claim the
destruction of the ill-fated "Caroline" as an overt act of
hostility.  Fortunately milder counsels prevailed and war was
avoided.  But this incident profoundly affected and prolonged
the agitation on the American side of the border.
</p>

<p>
On April 23rd, 1838, an "authorized agent" of the United
States Government, Mr. Aaron Vail, who had recently been
Chargé d'Affaires in the American Embassy in London, arrived
at Toronto.  Mr. Vail, according to the official despatch
of the British ambassador at Washington, Mr. H. S. Fox, was
charged with the task "of inquiring into, and reporting upon,
the actual condition of various individuals, who are now in
confinement in Canada."  Mr. Fox considered Mr. Vail a very
fitting envoy and that his mission would be beneficial "by
dissipating false rumours which tend to keep alive feelings of
ill-will between the British and American inhabitants on the
Canadian frontier."
</p>

<p>
Aaron Vail's mission seems to have fulfilled expectations,
for on April 25th Arthur wrote to Fox that it was quite
impossible that a more proper person than Mr. Vail could have
been selected by the President, and that he trusted all the
benefit would result from his mission as Fox had anticipated.  Vail
does not seem to have formed a very high opinion of the
American prisoners, whom he described as "the 'scum' of the
population."[<a id="chap01fn23text"></a><a href="#chap01fn23">23</a>]  Theller has left us an amusing account of how
the Toronto gaol was carefully scrubbed in honour of Vail's
visit and how the prison authorities hinted that "the Americans
had better clean and dress up, as they might expect to
see some visitors, and probably hear some good news."[<a id="chap01fn24text"></a><a href="#chap01fn24">24</a>]  The
prisoners poured out their tale of woe to Vail who "took notes
and assured us that the government of the United States would
strictly inquire into the matter."[<a id="chap01fn25text"></a><a href="#chap01fn25">25</a>]  Nothing much, however,
seems to have resulted from the inquiry, since it was evident
that Vail's mission was to smooth over affairs rather than to
stir up further strife by issuing an inflammatory report on
Canadian conditions.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the departure of Mr. Vail occurred the trial
and conviction of Charles Durand.  Durand's case was peculiar,
and noteworthy as illustrating the methods employed by
Arthur and his Executive Council to stamp out disaffection.
Durand was put on trial for high treason, the chief evidence
against him being a letter which was found in his house among
his papers addressed to W. L. MacKenzie, and which contained
within it charges against the Executive Council and Family
Compact generally.  This letter was never sent and MacKenzie
in his <i>Gazette</i> denies ever having seen it.  It was, therefore, a
high handed proceeding to sentence a man to death on the
evidence of a private paper which was never published.
Durand was afterwards respited and banished to the United
States, but his trial and conviction on the 7th of May did not
tend to increase the popularity of the Lieutenant-Governor and
his Executive Council.
</p>

<p>
Durand's letter certainly was written in no mild tone and
it still breathes forth the spirit of disaffection.  But it was
never published and as such should not have been used to
convict its author.  The following-sentences will serve as a sample
of the whole:
</p>

<p>
"The principles of the reformers are those of truth, are
those that tend to promote the happiness of the many&mdash;instead
of the few.  Although in common with thousands of the old
farmers in Canada, with thousands of the sons of U. E. Loyalists,
I was willing to petition the mother country for the redress
of our political wrongs, and even to petition them again
and again, yet when I see insult upon insult heaped upon the
reformers of this Province: our Governors allowed with
impunity to slander and laugh at the people and their House of
Assembly&mdash;when I see Governors who have held up with both
hands the gracious despatches of the deceitful and tyrannical
Colonial Office&mdash;conspiring against the liberties of this colony
by establishing a 'Dominant Church' and 'English Church
Rectories' amongst us against our will and desire, <i>raised,
promoted</i> and <i>applauded</i> for deceiving the people here, when I
see Judges suspended and dismissed from their offices for
voting for liberal men and the <i>elective franchise</i>, the only
spark of liberty we can boast of, trampled down by office
holders, and done away with by the Governor issuing thousands
of patent deeds to his favorites and officials, I begin to
ask myself, shall I, shall we, who have made the country what
it is, be used thus with impunity?  Shall we, the native Canadians,
the sons of U. E. Loyalists, be called aliens in the land
of our birth, and by the fluttering officials that hang on the
smiles of a Governor's brow&mdash;I say nay.  I feel that we are too
tame&mdash;that we have forgotten that we are free&mdash;that we are
in America,"[<a id="chap01fn26text"></a><a href="#chap01fn26">26</a>] etc. etc.
</p>

<p>
There is no need to quote more of this verbiage.  The
above is sufficient to show that Durand was able to "tear a
passion to tatters, to very rags," and if he had ever had this
letter published it would have doubtless "split the ears of the
groundlings."  The curious thing it that a man should be
condemned to death for writing such a letter.  Truly Arthur and
his Executive Council lacked a sense of humour!
</p>

<p>
About this time a new movement against Canada was on
foot in the United States.  "Hunters' Lodges" were formed
with the object "never to rest, till all tyrants of Britain cease
to have any dominion or footing whatever in North America."[<a id="chap01fn27text"></a><a href="#chap01fn27">27</a>]  This
new organization seems to have originated in May, 1838,
and to have spread rapidly, especially through the states
bordering on Upper Canada.  Lindsay tells us that at a
convention of the Hunters' Lodges of Ohio and Michigan held at
Cleveland from September 16th to 22nd[<a id="chap01fn28text"></a><a href="#chap01fn28">28</a>] of that year, seventy
delegates were present.  At this meeting a republican
government was appointed for Upper Canada, including a president
and complete cabinet.  A "republican bank of Upper Canada"
was projected which was to issue a paper currency adorned
with the heads of Lount, Matthews and Moreau who took part
in the Short Hills affair in June, 1838, to which reference will
shortly be made.  But the members of the "Hunters' Lodges"
though full of enthusiasm were short of funds, so the bank did
not prosper.
</p>

<p>
Before this grandiloquent meeting at Cleveland there had
been several disturbances along the border.  The first of these
was the destruction on May 30th, of the Canadian passenger
steamer "Sir Robert Peel" at Wells' Island by American
sympathizers.  Wells' Island, one of the Thousand Islands, is
situated in American waters and so the authorities of New York
state were to a certain extent negligent in allowing the
incident to occur.  The destruction of the "Sir Robert Peel" seems
to have been regarded by the "patriots" who boarded her as
an act of revenge for the burning of the "Caroline."  But
whatever the motives of those concerned the incident caused
bad feeling along the border.  An American steamer, the
"Telegraph," was fired upon on June 2nd by the Canadian
sentries at Brockville, the excuse given that the "Telegraph"
had not answered when hailed by the sentries.  An investigation
was held at which the authorities of St. Lawrence County,
N.Y., were present, and it was ascertained that the sentries
had acted without orders.
</p>

<p>
A few days after these incidents a body of "patriots"
under the leadership of James Moreau crossed the Niagara
frontier in order to free Upper Canada.  Moreau, who is called
Morrow in the Canadian records, issued a proclamation which
called upon the Canadians to come to his assistance and
proclaimed that this was the hour of their redemption.  The
answer of the "oppressed Canadians" was the engagement
fought at the Short Hills on June 21st when the "patriots"
were defeated by the Canadian militia.  Moreau fled with a
price on his head but was captured, tried and condemned to
death.  The Executive Council on July 26th refused to reprieve
him since he was considered a proper case for capital punishment
under an Act of the Parliament of Upper Canada passed
the previous session in order "to protect the Inhabitants of
this Province against lawless aggressions from Subjects of
Foreign Countries at Peace with Her Majesty."  Moreau was
accordingly executed at Niagara on July 30th.  If Sir George
Arthur had had his way there would have been more executions,
but Lord Durham intervened.
</p>

<p>
The next serious outbreak on the frontier was the attack
of von Schoultz near Prescott on November 11th.  The invaders
seized a point of land on which a stone windmill had been
built and fortified the place.  An engagement ensued and the
invaders were driven back to shelter within the windmill.  On
the 14th of November British reinforcements, including artillery,
arrived, and two days later an attack was made at the
distance of only 400 yards.  The garrison of the windmill then
surrendered and nearly 160 prisoners were taken.[<a id="chap01fn29text"></a><a href="#chap01fn29">29</a>]  Von
Schoultz and nine others were executed in Kingston.  Von
Schoultz was defended by Sir John A. Macdonald, then a young
barrister just beginning his profession, but there was little
that could be said in his defence.
</p>

<p>
The last movement against Upper Canada took place on
December 4th, when an attack was made on Windsor.  This
affair is thus described in the District General Orders of
December 10th, dated at Toronto:[<a id="chap01fn30text"></a><a href="#chap01fn30">30</a>]
</p>

<p>
"A large body of pirates and brigands, belonging to the
hostile combination in the neighbouring country which has of
late so much disturbed the peace of this province, after
assembling in the neighbourhood of Detroit, and showing themselves
at different points in the vicinity, at length had the hardihood
to effect a landing near Windsor, about three miles from
Sandwich, on the morning of the 4th instant, where they
commenced their work of destruction by burning a steam-boat
called the "Thames," and a house used as a barrack, making
prisoners a small but gallant party of militia quartered
therein, who, in defending themselves against the attacking
banditti shot their leader and eventually effected their escape."
</p>

<p>
At Sandwich, Colonel Prince gathered a force of local
militia, made "a spirited attack" and put the invaders to flight.
Four prisoners who had been taken were shot by orders of
Colonel Prince, whose action was afterward severely censured
by Lord Brougham and others.  After the action at Sandwich
the rest of the invaders either recrossed to American territory
or else took to the woods, where many perished from the cold.
So ended the last attempt at invasion of Upper Canada.  Seven
of those captured at Windsor were executed at London,
including Daniel Davis Bedford and Albert Clark.  The cases of
these two men were discussed at two separate meetings of the
Executive Council and it was decided that each of them
should suffer the death penalty.  In these decisions Sir George
Arthur entirely concurred.  The ex-governor of the penal
colony was still exacting vengeance.  In his defence it should
be stated that the loyal section of the province, including the
Executive Council, considered these men filibusters and
murderers.
</p>

<p>
The treatment meted out by the Executive Council to
those British subjects, American citizens and others who were
taken in arms against the government of Upper Canada has
been discussed at some length.  This has been done for two
reasons, first that it bulks so large in Sir George Arthur's
official despatches, and second because it shows what complete
harmony existed between Sir George and his Executive
Council.  Not even Sir Francis Head was more devoted to the
Family Compact party.  Sir George Arthur was by temperament
and training entirely on the side of established authority and
opposed to disaffection in all its forms.  A strong conservative,
he mistrusted the rule of the people and, therefore, opposed
as stubbornly as possible the popular demand for Responsible
Government.  In this, as in other respects, Arthur found
himself completely at variance with the Governor-General, the
Earl of Durham.
</p>

<p>
It was unfortunate for Arthur that he was in Upper
Canada during a period of unrest and transition.  It was even
more unfortunate for him that he was brought into contact
with Lord Durham.  Durham was a man of vision who sketched
out a mighty scheme which took years to put into actual
practice.  Arthur was a man of routine who could not appreciate
either Durham or his visions.  Above all he mistrusted
that pet project of Lord Durham, Responsible Government,
and did not hesitate to say so.
</p>

<p>
The appointment of the Earl of Durham as Governor-General
of the British North American provinces was deeply
resented by Sir George Arthur.  By virtue of his commission
Durham was empowered to assume the government of the
province in which he might be and to retain it during his
residence in that province.  During that period the functions of
the Lieutenant-Governor were to be altogether suspended.[<a id="chap01fn31text"></a><a href="#chap01fn31">31</a>]  Due
notice of this fact was sent each of the Lieutenant-Governors
of the British North American provinces including, of
course, Sir George Arthur.  After receiving this notice Sir
George wrote on June 5th, 1838, to Lord Glenelg, complaining
of this arrangement.  He based his case against it on his
experience in Van Diemen's Land, which was during his tenure
of office there a dependency of New South Wales, and called
to Lord Glenelg remembrance a conversation he had had with
him on the subject.  In fact, as Arthur reminds Glenelg, the
terms on which he consented to become Lieutenant-Governor
of Upper Canada were that no change of that sort would be
made.
</p>

<p>
Three days after writing thus to Lord Glenelg Sir George
Arthur received a circular letter from Lord Durham requesting
him "to enter into the most free and confidential communication
... on all subjects affecting the province of Upper
Canada, both as regards its internal condition and the state
of affairs on the frontiers."[<a id="chap01fn32text"></a><a href="#chap01fn32">32</a>]  Lord Durham included in this
letter the following paragraphs in order to allay the suspicion
that might exist in Arthur's mind that he wished to diminish
the Lieutenant-Governor's authority,
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency will of course understand that this request
does not contemplate any interference with your administration
of the government, but refers to the necessity which
exists that I, as Governor-General of all the North American
provinces, should be immediately informed of all matters of
general interest affecting the high and important mission
which has been conferred upon me.
</p>

<p>
"It will be my duty as well as my inclination to uphold
your authority, not only from the respect which I must entertain
for you personally, but from a due regard to the efficiency
of the public service."
</p>

<p>
This circular must have mollified Arthur somewhat, or
else he was too well trained a public servant to show his
innermost feelings.  At any rate he writes to Durham on June 9th
as follows,
</p>

<p>
"I sincerely thank your Lordship for your very kind
declaration of confidence in me and for the determination which
your Lordship has expressed of upholding my authority.
</p>

<p>
"It is peculiarly gratifying to me to receive these assurances
from your Lordship, for I ought in candour to say that
from the time I received Lord Glenelg's 'Circular,' I have been
very apprehensive of the embarrassment which might arise
out of the new relative position in which I found myself most
unexpectedly placed.  The immeasurable distinction between
your Lordship's station and my own must satisfy your
Lordship that this has proceeded from no vain jealousy, on
personal grounds, of the control of a superior.  With diminished
influence I feared the ability of being useful to Her Majesty's
Government and to this province would be taken away; for I
have to co-operate with a legislature which must have a
reasonable degree of confidence of my powers to act in union with
them, and to fulfil my professions.[<a id="chap01fn33text"></a><a href="#chap01fn33">33</a>]"
</p>

<p>
To this rather naïve letter Durham on June 18th replied
stating even more clearly that no act of his would diminish
Arthur's influence and authority in Upper Canada.  He goes
on to put his case as follows,
</p>

<p>
"I repeat to you, that I have no wish to interfere with the
local administration of the affairs of any of the provinces
included in my general government.
</p>

<p>
"Those functions will be vested, as before, in the
Lieutenant-Governors; but it is essential to the success of my mission
and to the due execution of my duties, more especially in the
present disturbed state of our relations with the frontier
population of the United States, that I should be promptly and
directly made acquainted with all events bearing on those
important questions."
</p>

<p>
Arthur seems to have followed out Durham's instructions
as regards frontier troubles to the letter, since we find the
following postscript added to his despatch of June 22nd, 1838
(No. 4):
</p>

<p>
"<i>P.S.</i> I make now no communications myself to the
American Government, and have troubled your Lordship with
all these particulars, as a representation will of course come
with far greater force from your Lordship."[<a id="chap01fn34text"></a><a href="#chap01fn34">34</a>]
</p>

<p>
In July, 1838, Lord Durham made a flying visit to Upper
Canada.  His object seems to have been to ascertain for
himself existing conditions in this province and to form his own
opinion as to what policy it would be best to pursue.  He
writes thus to Lord Glenelg from Montreal on July 6th:
</p>

<p>
"Lower Canada is perfectly free from internal troubles,
and her frontier is not menaced by the Americans; but Upper
Canada, by the last accounts from Sir George Arthur, is in a
very unsatisfactory state, both as to domestic dissensions and
border incursions.  I am anxious, therefore, to proceed there
as soon as possible."[<a id="chap01fn35text"></a><a href="#chap01fn35">35</a>]
</p>

<p>
Lord Durham left Montreal on July 10th, arrived in Kingston
late on the night of the 11th, and then proceeded to Niagara.
At Niagara Sir George Arthur met him.  From Niagara
Lord Durham journeyed to Toronto where Sir George was
also present to receive him formally, along with the mayor and
corporation and the citizens of the provincial capital.  On the
19th of July Durham returned to Kingston and thence down
the St. Lawrence to Montreal where he arrived on July 24th.
His visit to Upper Canada had been short but he had covered
a great deal of territory and seems to have been pleased with
what he saw.
</p>

<p>
If one of Lord Durham's objects in making his hurried
trip to Upper Canada was to obtain a better understanding
with Sir George Arthur he must have been disappointed since
shortly after his return to Lower Canada their relations
became somewhat strained.  The reason for this was the action
of Sir George Arthur and his Executive Council in sentencing
to death Samuel Chandler and Benjamin Waite for their part
in the Short Hills affair.  The families of these men had
appealed to Durham "for an extension of the Royal mercy" and
"for the grant to them of Her Majesty's pardon."[<a id="chap01fn36text"></a><a href="#chap01fn36">36</a>]  Durham
asked Arthur for particulars, reminding him that Lord
Glenelg had written on the 3rd of April asking that "the
utmost lenity, compatible with public safety, should be exercised
towards the insurgents."
</p>

<p>
To this Sir George Arthur replied on August 20th,
complaining that Durham's action was "depriving the officer
administering the Government of Upper Canada of the powers
expressly vested in him by the Royal Commission."[<a id="chap01fn37text"></a><a href="#chap01fn37">37</a>]  Arthur
also claimed that Durham "had misapprehended the intention
of the instruction of the Secretary of State" and Lord Glenelg
had in a despatch of July 12th referred him "to the power of
pardoning for treason vested in the officers administering this
government under your Lordship's commission as
Governor-in-Chief."
</p>

<p>
Durham in his turn maintained that all he wished was to
exercise the superintending authority he possessed as
Governor-General.  He admitted that Arthur had the power of
pardoning for treason delegated to him, but would argue that
that power was exempt from "the general subordination to
instructions from the Governor-General."[<a id="chap01fn38text"></a><a href="#chap01fn38">38</a>]  Durham then
proceeds to give his opinion of Sir George Arthur's policy in
the following terms.
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency's explanation of the policy which you
had determined on adopting with regard to the prisoners
convicted at Niagara does not immediately strike me as indicating
a course so obviously correct that I can dispense with the
information which I required in my despatch of the 16th
instant.  I cannot quite admit the propriety of selecting some
one subject of Her Majesty to share the fate of Morreau, the
leader of the expedition, who happened to be a citizen of the
United States.  The fate of Her Majesty's subjects should be
determined on a view of their own conduct, and of the
circumstances which have led the juries to accompany their
verdict of guilty, in every case, with a recommendation to
mercy."
</p>

<p>
A further despatch of Lord Durham to Arthur on September
18th went into the case of Jacob Beamer in some detail.
Beamer had been singled out by the Executive Council
as the scape goat and was alone to suffer the death penalty.
To this Durham would not agree but requested that the case
be referred to Lord Glenelg.  This despatch is interesting since
it shows that the Executive Council of Upper Canada was at
this time none too friendly towards Lord Durham and was
quite willing to stir up strife between the Governor-General
and the Lieutenant-Governor.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the correspondence between Arthur and
Durham had continued at some length and not always with
the best of feeling.  But no actual breach seems to have
occurred and at length the vexed problem of the political
prisoners seemed likely of solution.  A general amnesty was to be
proclaimed for all except a certain few who were to be named
in the proclamation.  But by this time Lord Durham was
preparing to return to England.
</p>

<p>
Among the despatches sent by Sir George Arthur to the
Earl of Durham is one dated July 9th, 1838, which deals with
the political condition of Upper Canada.  This letter
establishes without a doubt the close adherence of Sir George
Arthur to the Family Compact party, all the more so because
Sir George tries to claim his independence of all party
affiliations.  It also shows that the Lieutenant-Governor had
received instructions from the Home Government "to pursue the
policy and measures of Sir Francis Head."  This Arthur
apparently had attempted to do in so far as his support of the
dominant party in the province was concerned.  He had fallen
in completely with their way of thinking and had failed to
distinguish between reformers and rebels.  He even warned Lord
Sydenham that Dr. Egerton Ryerson was "a dangerous man"
chiefly because Ryerson supported Mr. Bidwell, who had been
Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and had been forced to
leave the province on account of persecution by Sir Francis
Head and his Executive Council after MacKenzie's Rebellion.
In this letter of July 9th Sir George Arthur attempts to
combat the opinions of Mr. Isaac Buchanan, a reformer, who had
been presenting his views on the Upper Canadian political
situation to Lord Durham.  According to Arthur, Mr. Buchanan
was endeavouring to prejudice Durham's mind
"against some of the most respectable and most highly
esteemed men in the province," and the Lieutenant-Governor
hastened to defend his friends.  One or two sentences from
this despatch deserve quotation as showing Arthur's attitude
towards the self-constituted aristocracy of Upper Canada.
</p>

"In this Colony, as in other countries, respectable station,
united with superior talents and good conduct, gives a certain
degree of influence which is natural and salutary, and it would
be of all things ungracious and discouraging, as well as
impolitic, if the Government were to manifest a jealousy of an
influence so honorably acquired.  It is, so far as I have been
able to judge, most unobtrusively exercised and I am satisfied,
from what I have experienced, that so far as he can
conscientiously do so, your Lordship will have the most cordial
co-operation of the Chief Justice and of all the Family
Compact, in all its ramifications throughout the Province."[<a id="chap01fn39text"></a><a href="#chap01fn39">39</a>]
</p>

<p>
In this same despatch Arthur informs Durham that he
had "amicably discussed with the Leaders of each Denomination,
the long contested Clergy Reserves Question," and had
the intention of "bringing in a Bill to reinvest those lands in
the Crown" if better means could not be found of providing
a settlement.  He also thought that he would be able to carry
any measure he desired successfully through the Provincial
Parliament.  It should be remembered that the ultra-tory
assembly of 1836, at whose elections Sir Francis Head so
distinguished himself, was still in existence and that Sir George
Arthur thought that it would pass any measure brought
forward by the government.  Already on a previous occasion Sir
George had written to the Governor-General on the same
subject of the Clergy Reserves and had expressed a hope that
asperities had been already softened and that at the next
meeting of the Legislature he would be able to see this
long-pending contest terminated upon nearly the same principle as
it had been settled in Van Diemen's Land during his
administration there.  But in this pious hope Arthur reckoned
without the opposition of the Reformers.
</p>

<p>
The aim of Sir George Arthur and the Executive Council
was "to secure the removal of the Clergy Reserves question
from the hostile arena of the Upper Canada Legislature to
the friendly atmosphere of the English House of Commons,
and the still more friendly tribunal of the House of Lords&mdash;where
the bench of bishops would be sure to defend the claims
of the Church to their royal patrimony."[<a id="chap01fn40text"></a><a href="#chap01fn40">40</a>]  This project the
Reformers and opponents of the Clergy Reserves were determined
to resist to the uttermost.  A long controversy raged
during 1838 and 1839.  In December, 1837, a bill had been
brought forward to reinvest the Reserves in the Crown, but
a despatch from the Home Government which arrived soon
after showed that the British Parliamentary authorities had
no desire to interfere in the settlement of this vexed question.
During 1838 Sir George Arthur still hoped that the scheme
for reinvesting the Clergy Reserves in the Crown would carry
as the references in his despatches, cited above, show.  Such
a bill would have suited the members of the Executive Council
and Family Compact generally.  It would have meant that
the Church of England would have still profited at the expense
of the other denominations.  As it was, in 1837 out of a total
of £10,852 11s 8d the Church of England received £7,291 5s Od,
the Church of Scotland £1,425, the United Synod of Upper
Canada £636 6s 8d, and the Roman Catholic clergy £1,000.[<a id="chap01fn41text"></a><a href="#chap01fn41">41</a>]  The
Wesleyan Methodists and other denominations did not
receive one penny from the "one-seventh of all Crown lands set
aside for the support of a Protestant clergy."
</p>

<p>
Upon the reassembling of the Upper Canadian Legislature
in February, 1839, Sir George Arthur stated that "the
settlement of this vitally important question ought not to be
longer delayed" and hoped that the contending parties could
be amicably adjusted, but added meaningly that if all their
efforts failed it would only remain to reinvest the Reserves in
the hands of the Crown.  Various bills on the subject were
introduced and finally the Legislative Council amended one
sent to it by the Assembly in such a way as to put complete
control of the Clergy Reserves in the hands of the Imperial
Parliament.  This bill as amended was passed in the Assembly
in a thin house by a majority of one.  Sir George Arthur and
his party had triumphed by a narrow margin.  But the royal
assent was never given to the bill owing to an objection raised
in England that the Upper Canadian Legislature, being a
subordinate authority, could not make such a delegation to the
Imperial Parliament.
</p>

<p>
A compromise bill which was devised to meet the approval
of the majority of people in Upper Canada was submitted to
the House of Assembly in January, 1840, but it was the work
not of Sir George Arthur, but of Lord Durham's successor,
Mr. Poulett Thomson (Lord Sydenham).  It provided that the
remainder of the land should be sold and that the annual
proceeds of the fund, when realized, be distributed one half to
the Church of England and the Presbyterians and one half to
the other denominations who wished to share it.  This bill was
passed in Upper Canada and sent to England where it met its
death blow in the House of Lords.  The vexatious Clergy
Reserves problem still remained unsettled.
</p>

<p>
In the matter of the Clergy Reserves, Sir George Arthur
had shown himself the uncompromising ally of the Family
Compact.  He was to show it once more in his attitude towards
the reunion of the provinces and the introduction of
Responsible Government.
</p>

<p>
The reunion of the provinces was urged by Lord Durham
in his Report and was favoured by a large majority of the
inhabitants of Upper Canada.  It was opposed by the Family
Compact, supported as usual by Sir George Arthur.  But the
feeling for union was so strong that on March 23rd, 1839,
three resolutions in favour of the reunion of the provinces
were carried by the Upper Canadian Legislature.  Four days
later, on March 27th, fourteen qualifying resolutions were
passed by the Assembly.  These resolutions, if embodied in the
Act of Union, would have placed the balance of power in the
hands of the British population of the united province.
</p>

<p>
A committee of the Legislative Council was appointed at
the same time to inquire into Lord Durham's Report and to
put forward their side of the case.  This was very ably done
in a document dated May 11th, 1839, and approved by the
Legislative Council.  In this report on the Report Lord
Durham's "great panacea for all political disorders 'Responsible
Government'"[<a id="chap01fn42text"></a><a href="#chap01fn42">42</a>] was attacked and certain inaccurate statements
were challenged.  The blame for the recent troubles in
Upper Canada was cast entirely upon the Reformers and the
question propounded: "Is it because reformers, or a portion
of them, can command the sympathies of the United States,
and of Lower Canadian rebels, that the internal affairs of a
British colony must be conducted so as to please them?"
</p>

<p>
With these sentiments Sir George Arthur heartily concurred.
He was entirely opposed to "Responsible Government"
and still feared disaffection in the provinces.  During the
early months of 1839 the trials of the political prisoners had
continued and had attracted much attention on both sides of
the border.  There was still considerable excitement in the
province and riots occurred in some places.  In one of these
which took place at Stone's Tavern, Percy Township, Northumberland
County, on June 5th, 1839, the reformers carried "a
red flag on which were written or printed the words, 'Lord
Durham and Reform.'"[<a id="chap01fn43text"></a><a href="#chap01fn43">43</a>]  Incidents such as this increased Sir
George Arthur's mistrust of Lord Durham's schemes for the
better government of Canada, and on July 2nd we find him
writing to the Marquis of Normanby, Lord Glenelg's successor,
as follows:
</p>

<p>
"I have all along informed Her Majesty's Government
that it is absurd to think of Upper Canada as containing a
whole community of loyalists.  There is a considerable section
of persons who are disloyal to the core; reform is on their
lips, but separation is in their hearts.  These men having, for
the last two or three years, made a 'responsible government'
their watchword, are now extravagantly elated because the
Earl of Durham has recommended that measure.
</p>

<p>
"They regard it as an unerring means to get rid of all
British connexion, while the Earl of Durham, on the contrary,
has recommended it as a measure for cementing the existing
bond of union with the mother country."
</p>

<p>
These few sentences throw great light on Sir George
Arthur's attitude on the question of 'Responsible Government.'  As
usual, the Reformers are annexationists.  It was the usual
tactics of the dominant party to call them so and to include
as disloyal all those who favoured the cause of Reform.  Of
course Sir George Arthur, from the nature of his position, was
supposed to be moderate in his political views, but he does
yeoman service for the Family Compact in trying to impress
upon the authorities in England that the Reformers were
disloyal.  It is impossible to state what percentage of the
Reformers were actually disloyal, but it must be remembered, as
Egerton Ryerson has told us, the great body of the Reformers
took no part in MacKenzie's Rebellion except to suppress it.
The bulk of moderate opinion in the province sided neither
with the annexationists nor with the Family Compact, but
readily embraced the suggestions set forth in Lord Durham's
Report.  With these moderate reformers Sir George Arthur
was soon at variance.
</p>

<p>
In the month of August, 1839, Sir George received a series
of resolutions supporting Lord Durham's Report and
Responsible Government passed at a meeting of freeholders and
inhabitants of the Gore District held on July 27th.  This
meeting resolved that the House of Assembly did not represent the
wishes or sentiments of the province "particularly in its late
Report of its committee, purporting to be the Report of the
House of Assembly in answer to Lord Durham's Report on the
State of the Province."  It also resolved "that the Report of
the Earl of Durham, in all its material points, has been
received by an overwhelming majority of the people of Upper
Canada with the most abundant gratification" and "that this
meeting is of opinion that a responsible government, as
recommended in Lord Durham's Report, is the only means of
restoring confidence, allaying discontent, or perpetuating the
connexion between Great Britain and this colony."[<a id="chap01fn44text"></a><a href="#chap01fn44">44</a>]
</p>

<p>
All this was wormwood and gall to Sir George Arthur,
who hastened to reply to this address.  In his answer he
attacks Responsible Government and states "that the proposed
plan would lead to a state of things inconsistent with the
relations of this colony, as a dependency of the British
Crown."  This was a bold statement for the Lieutenant-Governor to
make and it was soon to land him into difficulties since the
British authorities were prepared to carry out Lord Durham's
schemes.  Mr. Poulett Thomson was selected as Governor-General
and under him Sir George Arthur was once more to
act as a subordinate Lieutenant-Governor.[<a id="chap01fn45text"></a><a href="#chap01fn45">45</a>]
</p>

<p>
It was a curious arrangement, since Arthur was known
to be opposed to the very scheme of government which Poulett
Thomson was being sent out to initiate.  But Sir George
Arthur was not unwilling to co-operate with the new
Governor-General.  He met Poulett Thomson at Montreal on October
25th and conferred with him on the subject of Upper Canada.
It was decided that the Legislature of that province should be
summoned for December 3rd and that Poulett Thomson would
visit Upper Canada about the 18th of November.  The
Governor-General was determined to open the session of the
Legislature in person.  This determination on his part was largely
the outcome of his conversations with Sir George Arthur, who
strongly urged upon him the desirability of so doing.
</p>

<p>
As a result of this meeting between the Governor-General
and Lieutenant-Governor, Poulett Thomson was present to
open the Legislature on December 3rd.  After that date Sir
George Arthur's power in Upper Canada became entirely
secondary to that of Poulett Thomson.  He still acted as
Lieutenant-Governor in the absence of the Governor-General
but his term of real authority in Upper Canada ended on
November 22nd, 1839, when the new Governor-General
assumed the government of the upper province.
</p>

<p>
Sir George Arthur remained in Upper Canada until 1841,
when the Act of Union came into force and the two provinces
surrendered their separate existence.  He then returned to
England where his services in Canada were recognized by the
bestowal upon him of a baronetcy.  In June, 1842, he was
appointed Governor of the Bombay Presidency in India, which
office he held until his retirement in 1846.  Had his health
warranted the acceptance of so difficult a post he might then
have become Governor-General of India.  After returning to
England Sir George Arthur was made a Privy Councillor and
was honoured by the University of Oxford with the honorary
degree of Doctor of Civil Law.  He died on September 19th,
1854.
</p>

<p>
Sir George Arthur was a true type of the old colonial
governor.  He was unfortunate in that he was unable to realize
that the days of colonial dependency were numbered, and that
the future belonged to the advocates of self-government.  His
long experience as a colonial governor under the old regime,
probably told against Arthur in his administration of Upper
Canada just as it was of value to him as Governor of Bombay.
His support of the Family Compact was as natural and sincere
as his mistrust of Responsible Government.  Of his uprightness
and integrity there could be no doubt.  Although his treatment
of the political prisoners shows him to have been merciless,
on occasion he was known as a gentle and kind man.  He
tried to do what he considered right but he lacked vision.
Throughout his administration in Upper Canada he was
attempting to bolster up a dying cause.  His one fatal defect was
that he could not see that the political future of Canada lay
in the proper interpretation and elaboration of the principles
laid down in Lord Durham's Report.
